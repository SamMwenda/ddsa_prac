# DDSA - (Dart, Data Structures & Algorithims)

The repo documents my journey as I study the dart language. The main focus of the repo is to potray the implementation of data structures and algorithims using the dart language. Despite using the dart language, I decided to go for a more soft-brute approach (because am using an oop language very similar to dart in many aspects) and use material created for Java programming language.
